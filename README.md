# Behaviour Tree AI Study: Mr X - Resident Evil 2 Remake
A technical exploration and recreation of the 'Mr X' AI system from Resident Evil 2 Remake (2019) using my own implementation of a Behaviour Tree system. This project serves as my first foray into studying video game AI, starting with creating a Behaviour Tree from the ground up.

Mr. X is an enemy AI that hunts the player through a large building; stalking the halls and searching rooms. I've attempted to mimic that behaviour while learning to create my own basic Behaviour Tree system.

## Features
- A project exploring video game AI, recreating RE2’s ‘Mr X’ with a **Behaviour Tree built from scratch** within Unity.
- **Composite and Action nodes** resembling patrol, search, chase and attack behaviours.
- **Room System** with AI Door handling for Room-to-Room navigation.
- **Object-Oriented architecture** using inheritance to define type-based and **abstract logic**.
- Fully playable with traditional gameplay systems to test AI implementation in a game setting.
