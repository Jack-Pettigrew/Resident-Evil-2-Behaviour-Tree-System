# Resident-Evil-2-Hunting-System
A recreation and technical exploration of the Mr. X Hunting System from Resident Evil 2 (2019). This project serves as my first attempt into studying and creating a similar AI using a Behaviour Tree from the ground up.

Mr. X is an enemy that hunts the player through a large building; stalking the halls and searching rooms. I've attempted to mimic that behaviour while learning to create my own basic Behaviour Tree system.
